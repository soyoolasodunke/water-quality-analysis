# Water Quality Sensor Data Analysis Dashboard
This project uses Power BI to analyze and visualize water quality sensor data from various European countries. The goal is to turn raw data into actionable insights by cleaning, modeling, and visualizing the data. This will involve creating interactive dashboards and visualizations to identify trends, anomalies, and comparisons, ultimately supporting regulatory compliance and environmental sustainability.

### Data
This dataset comprises over one million rows and 32 columns of aggregated water sensor data collected across several European countries. It details water quality, including country, water body category, and the minimum, maximum, mean, and median concentration levels of various determinants. The data also includes the number of quality samples taken and is time-stamped, reflecting ongoing data collection at various monitoring sites.

### Tech Stack
- Tool: Power BI
- Database: Microsoft SQL Server
- Services: Microsoft Fabric
